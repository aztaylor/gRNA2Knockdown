	abstract = {DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that can introduce negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. It is essential in all bacteria but absent from higher eukaryotes, making it an attractive target for antibacterials. The fluoroquinolones are examples of very successful gyrase-targeted drugs, but the rise in bacterial resistance to these agents means that we not only need to seek new compounds, but also new modes of inhibition of this enzyme. We review known gyrase-specific drugs and toxins and assess the prospects for developing new antibacterials targeted to this enzyme.},

	abstract = {Summary
Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems endow microbes with diverse mechanisms for adaptive immunity. Here, we analyzed prokaryotic genome and metagenome sequences to identify an uncharacterized family of RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR systems that we classify as type VI-D. Biochemical characterization and protein engineering of seven distinct orthologs generated a ribonuclease effector derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens XPD3002 (CasRx) with robust activity in human cells. CasRx-mediated knockdown exhibits high efficiency and specificity relative to RNA interference across diverse endogenous transcripts. As one of the most compact single-effector Cas enzymes, CasRx can also be flexibly packaged into adeno-associated virus. We target virally encoded, catalytically inactive CasRx to cis elements of pre-mRNA to manipulate alternative splicing, alleviating dysregulated tau isoform ratios in a neuronal model of frontotemporal dementia. Our results present CasRx as a programmable RNA-binding module for efficient targeting of cellular RNA, enabling a general platform for transcriptome engineering and future therapeutic development.},

@article{Jinek2012,
	abstract = {Bacteria and archaea protect themselves from invasive foreign nucleic acids through an RNA-mediated adaptive immune system called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/CRISPR-associated (Cas). Jinek et al. (p. 816, published online 28 June; see the Perspective by Brouns) found that for the type II CRISPR/Cas system, the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as well as the trans-activating crRNA---which is known to be involved in the pre-crRNA processing---were both required to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave the invading target DNA. Furthermore, engineered RNA molecules were able to program the Cas9 endonuclease to cleave specific DNA sequences to generate double-stranded DNA breaks. A prokaryotic RNA--directed targeting system can be designed to cleave any DNA sequence. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

@article{SHMAKOV2015385,
	abstract = {Summary
Microbial CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into Class 1, with multisubunit effector complexes, and Class 2, with single protein effectors. Currently, only two Class 2 effectors, Cas9 and Cpf1, are known. We describe here three distinct Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems. The effectors of two of the identified systems, C2c1 and C2c3, contain RuvC-like endonuclease domains distantly related to Cpf1. The third system, C2c2, contains an effector with two predicted HEPN RNase domains. Whereas production of mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) by C2c1 depends on tracrRNA, C2c2 crRNA maturation is tracrRNA independent. We found that C2c1 systems can mediate DNA interference in a 5′-PAM-dependent fashion analogous to Cpf1. However, unlike Cpf1, which is a single-RNA-guided nuclease, C2c1 depends on both crRNA and tracrRNA for DNA cleavage. Finally, comparative analysis indicates that Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems evolved on multiple occasions through recombination of Class 1 adaptation modules with effector proteins acquired from distinct mobile elements.},

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}}

Two proteins of different sizes were identified by the maxicell method, one corresponding to the Iap protein and the other corresponding to the processed product without the signal peptide.

	abstract = {Dynamically altering protein concentration is a central activity in synthetic biology. While many tools are available to modulate protein concentration by altering protein synthesis rate, methods for decreasing protein concentration by inactivation or degradation rate are just being realized. Altering protein synthesis rates can quickly increase the concentration of a protein but not decrease, as residual protein will remain for a while. Inducible, targeted protein degradation is an attractive option and some tools have been introduced for higher organisms and bacteria. Current bacterial tools rely on C-terminal fusions, so we have developed an N-terminal fusion (Ntag) strategy to increase the possible proteins that can be targeted. We demonstrate Ntag dependent degradation of mCherry and beta-galactosidase and reconfigure the Ntag system to perform dynamic, exogenously inducible degradation of a targeted protein and complement protein depletion by traditional synthesis repression. Model driven analysis that focused on rates, rather than concentrations, was critical to understanding and engineering the system. We expect this tool and our model to enable inducible protein degradation use particularly in metabolic engineering, biological study of essential proteins, and protein circuits.},

	abstract = {The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) system has altered life science research offering enormous options in manipulating, detecting, imaging, and annotating specific DNA or RNA sequences of diverse organisms. This system incorporates fragments of foreign DNA (spacers) into CRISPR cassettes, which are further transcribed into the CRISPR arrays and then processed to make guide RNA (gRNA). The CRISPR arrays are genes that encode Cas proteins. Cas proteins provide the enzymatic machinery required for acquiring new spacers targeting invading elements. Due to programmable sequence specificity, numerous Cas proteins such as Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 have been exploited to develop new tools for genome engineering. Cas variants stimulated genetic research and propelled the CRISPR/Cas tool for manipulating and editing nucleic acid sequences of living cells of diverse organisms. This review aims to provide detail on two classes (class 1 and 2) of the CRISPR/Cas system, and the mechanisms of all Cas proteins, including Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14 discovered so far. In addition, we also discuss the pros and cons and recent applications of various Cas proteins in diverse fields, including those used to detect viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review enables the researcher to gain knowledge on various Cas proteins and their applications, which have the potential to be used in next-generation precise genome engineering.},

	abstract = {Recently, arrays of clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) have been implicated in a novel genetic interference pathway that limits phage infection and plasmid conjugation. CRISPR loci keep a record of past infections to provide bacteria and archaea with a 'genetic memory' that directs the rejection of invader DNA molecules; therefore these loci constitute an adaptive immune system.CRISPRs (which are approximately 25--50 nucleotides long) are separated by similarly short sequences called spacers that match bacteriophage or plasmid sequences and specify the targets of interference. CRISPR-associated (cas) genes, a set of conserved genes that are associated with these loci, are usually present on one or the other side of the array.CRISPR loci are transcribed as a long precursor that is processed by Cas proteins within the repeat sequences to generate small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs). The crRNAs serve as guides for target recognition during CRISPR interference. crRNA--Cas ribonucleoprotein complexes seem to generally target invading DNA sequences during interference but may also target RNAs in some species.Upon bacteriophage challenge of a CRISPR-containing bacterial population, mutants resistant to the infection arise through the incorporation of additional spacer sequences derived from the challenging phage. This allows the bacteria to evolve rapidly and adapt to the viruses in the environment.Bacteriophages and plasmids can mobilize foreign genetic material between cells, a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which is a fundamental source of genetic variability for the evolution of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR interference prevents phage infection and plasmid conjugation and therefore constitutes a natural barrier to HGT. In addition, bacteriophages constantly mutate to evade CRISPR defence. Therefore, CRISPR interference has an important role in the evolution of microbial communities.},

    abstract = { The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system in bacteria and archaea that functions via a distinct self-non-self recognition mechanism that is partially analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). The CRISPR-Cas system incorporates fragments of virus or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR repeat cassettes and employs the processed transcripts of these spacers as guide RNAs to cleave the cognate foreign DNA or RNA. The Cas proteins, however, are not homologous to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread RNA-binding domain. Despite the fast evolution that is typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that typically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins of COG1517 that, in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain different nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. The tight association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted toxins that, upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled. Such coupling could manifest in the persistence state being induced and potentially providing conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in cell death being triggered when immunity fails. }}

A markedly salt-dependent differential expression has been detected in the nearby regions. Two of the open reading frames characterized correspond to two of the differentially expressed transcripts. In both cases the PstI sites were included in purine–pyrimidine alternancies suggestive of Z-DNA structures and located in non–coding regions with frequent repetitive motifs. A long alternating adenine-thymine tract also appears in the upstream regions of one of these open reading frames.

    abstract = {Negative supercoiling of bacterial DNA by DNA gyrase influences all metabolic processes involving DNA and is essential for replication. Gyrase supercoils DNA by a mechanism called sign inversion, whereby a positive supercoil is directly inverted to a negative one by passing a DNA segment through a transient double-strand break. Reversal of this scheme relaxes DNA, and this mechanism also accounts for the ability of gyrase to catenate and uncatenate DNA rings. Each round of supercoiling is driven by a conformational change induced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding: ATP hydrolysis permits fresh cycles. The inhibition of gyrase by two classes of antimicrobials reflects its composition from two reversibly associated subunits. The A subunit is particularly associated with the concerted breakage-and-rejoining of DNA and the B subunit mediates energy transduction. Gyrase is a prototype for a growing class of prokaryotic and eukaryotic topoisomerases that interconvert complex forms by way of transient double-strand breaks.}}

This process is subject to reversible corruption by fluoroquinolones, antibacterials that form drug-enzyme-DNA complexes in which the DNA is broken. The complexes, called cleaved complexes because of the presence of DNA breaks, have been crystallized and found to have the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring system facing the GyrB/ParE subunits. As expected from x-ray crystallography, a thiol-reactive, C-7-modified chloroacetyl derivative of ciprofloxacin (Cip-AcCl) formed cross-linked cleaved complexes with mutant GyrB-Cys466 gyrase as evidenced by resistance to reversal by both EDTA and thermal treatments. Surprisingly, cross-linking was also readily seen with complexes formed by mutant GyrA-G81C gyrase, thereby revealing a novel drug-gyrase interaction not observed in crystal structures. The cross-link between fluoroquinolone and GyrA-G81C gyrase correlated with exceptional bacteriostatic activity for Cip-AcCl with a quinolone-resistant GyrA-G81C variant of Escherichia coli and its Mycobacterium smegmatis equivalent (GyrA-G89C). Cip-AcCl-mediated, irreversible inhibition of DNA replication provided further evidence for a GyrA-drug cross-link. Collectively these data establish the existence of interactions between the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring and both GyrA and GyrB. Because the GyrA-Gly81 and GyrB-Glu466 residues are far apart (17 ?) in the crystal structure of cleaved complexes, two modes of quinolone binding must exist. The presence of two binding modes raises the possibility that multiple quinolone-enzyme-DNA complexes can form, a discovery that opens new avenues for exploring and exploiting relationships between drug structure and activity with type II DNA topoisomerases.},

The cross-link between fluoroquinolone and GyrA-G81C gyrase correlated with exceptional bacteriostatic activity for Cip-AcCl with a quinolone-resistant GyrA-G81C variant of Escherichia coli and its Mycobacterium smegmatis equivalent (GyrA-G89C). Cip-AcCl-mediated, irreversible inhibition of DNA replication provided further evidence for a GyrA-drug cross-link. Collectively these data establish the existence of interactions between the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring and both GyrA and GyrB. Because the GyrA-Gly81 and GyrB-Glu466 residues are far apart (17 ?) in the crystal structure of cleaved complexes, two modes of quinolone binding must exist. The presence of two binding modes raises the possibility that multiple quinolone-enzyme-DNA complexes can form, a discovery that opens new avenues for exploring and exploiting relationships between drug structure and activity with type II DNA topoisomerases.},

    abstract = {Since the discovery of RNA-programmable nucleases from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system CRISPR–Cas, these proteins have seen rapid and widespread adoption for biotechnological and clinical research. A recently discovered system, CRISPR–Cas13, uses CRISPR RNA guides to target RNA. Interestingly, RNA targeting by Cas13 results in cleavage of both target RNA and bystander RNA. This feature has been used to develop innovative diagnostic tools for the detection of specific RNAs. Unlike in vitro detection of RNA using collateral RNA cleavage, however, initial studies of mammalian cells only revealed highly specific target RNA-knockdown activity. Although these findings have been confirmed subsequently, several recent publications do report Cas13-mediated toxicity and collateral RNA cleavage when using Cas13 in eukaryotes. Here, we review these conflicting observations and discuss its potential molecular basis.}

abstract = {The B-to-Z structural transition of varying lengths (74 to 14 base-pairs) of (CG) tracts has been used as a superhelicity probe to examine the local topological changes induced by transcription at defined genetic loci in vivo. The local-topology reporter sequences indicate that under steady-state transcription the region upstream from the promoter experiences an increase in negative supercoiling whereas the region downstream from the terminator displays a decrease in negative superhelicity. This result provides direct in vivo evidence for the notion that the translocation of an RNA polymerase elongation complex along the double-helical DNA generates positive supercoils in front of it and negative supercoils behind it. Also, this twin-supercoiled domain model was tested inside a transcribed region where a high degree of negative supercoiling generated by the passage of each individual RNA polymerase was detected. Hence, these data indicate that the induced supercoils are confined to the vicinity of each RNA polymerase complex in a multipolymerase system.}
