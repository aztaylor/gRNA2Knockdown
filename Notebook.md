# This is meant to be a notebook of my experiments
The idea is to use the notebook to recrord arbitrarty hyperparameter choices in the face of teaching a new neural network architectrure. Hopefully it will supply a guidance that wish to use my code in the future.

## Preamble
For the record, this is a series of experiments I have had with the intentention of predicting the of CasRx in gene translation withing the prokaryotes, specifically E. coli in this case. The remaining lines are a realization of the computational expirements with which I have derived my conclusions. Here I will paste my experimentaion and results for record.

## Experimental Procedures
The data that is used for training here is derived from an oligo based cloning technique which is effectictive in creating CRISPR gRNA vectors. The resultin plasmids can be used to target specific genes. The dataset used is focused on the is available in the github repository and is focused on a 3nt tilling of GFP. The architecthure in graphical form will be placed later.

Best,
Alec
